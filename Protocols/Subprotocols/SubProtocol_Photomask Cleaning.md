# Sub-Protocol: Photomask Cleaning

Description: This document details the protocol for the cleaning glass/chromium photomasks. This step is not necessary for freshly manufactured, unused photomasks.

## Materials:
* *Acetone*
* *Isopropanol*
* *Nanostrip*

## Equipment:
* *Glass tank designated for Nanostrip*
* *Hotplate*
* *Teflon mask holder*
* *Mask tweezers*
* *HDPE trays*

## Process:

1. Safety
   1. Nanostrip is very hazardous. Wear acid-resistant gloves, goggles, and chemical apron at a minimum. All work should be conducted in a corrosives fume hood

2. Solvent clean
<br> _Note: perform in chemical fume hood_
   1. Soak the photomask in a shallow acetone bath in a solvent compatible receptacle (HDPE tray labeled for solvent use, or glass tank designated for photoresist stripping). Liberally spray with acetone to remove large debris and significant photoresist residue
   2. Repeat with a shallow bath of isopropanol
   3. Repeat with deionized water
   4. Blow dry with N<sub>2</sub>

3. Nanostrip Clean
<br> _Note: perform in corrosives appropriate fume hood_
   1. Fill the glass Nanostrip tank with a shallow layer of solution, enough to cover the photomask
   2. Place the tank on a hotplate and set to 60 °C. Allow plate to reach temperature
   3. Prepare two HDPE trays with deionized water for rinsing
   4. Place the photomask in the Teflon mask holder chrome/pattern side up
   5. Carefully transfer the mask to the tank still in the holder and let soak for > 10 minutes
   6. Carefully transfer the mask to the first rinsing tray and rinse briefly
   7. Transfer mask to the second tray and rinse 5× with deionized water
   8. Blow dry photomask with N<sub>2</sub>

4. Clean and Dispose of Nanostrip
   1. Turn-off hotplate and allow solution to reach room temperature
   2. While waiting, fully rinse water trays and mask holder and dry thoroughly
   3. When the solution has cooled, decant carefully with aid of glass funnel into labeled glass waste beaker
   4. Triple rinse tank
