These are the current microfabrication, packaging, and assembly protocols for manufacturing Parylene C based microelectrode arrays. Protocols were developed by PIE Foundry staff and derived from work at the [Biomedical Microsystems Laboratory](http://biomems.usc.edu/) of Dr. Ellis Meng at the University of Southern California.
